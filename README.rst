A Developer tutorial on creating LV2 plug-ins by using its C interface directly:

The DISTRHO Plugin Framework (DPF):
   https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF

   DPF allows to create plug-ins in different formats with custom UIs using a
   simple C++ API. We are using this framework in this workshop to create our
   plug-ins.

A presentation by DPF's author falkTX:

WDL / IPlug (Oli Larkin Edition):
   https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol

   A framework very similar to DPF, but orientated more towards developing for 
   Windows and OS X (i.e. supports AU plug-ins)

A very good multi-part tutorial on developing plug-ins with WDL-OL:

   The WaveTable oscillator and ADSR envelope classes we are using in this
   workshop originate there.
